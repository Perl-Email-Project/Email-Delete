NAME
    Email::Delete - Delete Messages from Folders

SYNOPSIS
      use Email::Delete qw[delete_message];
  
      my $message_id = shift @ARGV;
  
      delete_messages from     => $ENV{MAIL},
                      matching => sub {
                          my $message = shift;
                          $message->header('Message-ID') =~ $message_id;
                      };

DESCRIPTION
    This software will delete messages from a given folder if the test
    returns true.

  delete_message
      delete_message from     => 'folder_name',
                     with     => 'My::Delete::Package',
                     matching => sub { return_true_for_delete() };

    "from" is a required parameter, a string containing the folder name to
    delete from. By default "Email::FolderType" is used to determine what
    package to use when deleting a message. To override the default, specify
    the "with" parameter. Your package's "delete_message" function will be
    called with the same arguments that "delete_message" from Email::Delete
    is called with.

    "matching" is a required argument. Its value is a code reference. If the
    anonymouse subroutine returns a true value, the current message is
    deleted. Each message is passed to the "matching" test in turn. The
    first and only argument to "matching" is an "Email::Simple" object
    representing the message.

    If you should ever want to stop processing a mailbox, just call "die"
    from your code reference. A proper deleting package will not delete mail
    until all the messages have been scanned. So if you throw an exception,
    your mail will be preserved and scanning will be aborted.
